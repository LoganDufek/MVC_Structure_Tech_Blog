## Challenge Fourteen MVC_Structure_Tech_Blog

### Description
For this week's challenge, we were tasked with essentially compiling everything we have learned throughout this bootcamp to create a functioning Tech Blog hosted on Heroku. This was a fun challenge to go along with our firt project since we are doing simmilar things. It was interesting to get back to flexing CSS muscles that I hadn't used in a while, since we have been largely focusing on the back end of applications. 

As for the MVC structure, it was I think effective for keeping everthing neat and in order. It also made dissecting a particular problem easier since the functionaliy, or in an error's case lackthereof, could be traced to one of a couple files. There defenitely a bit of a learning curve, but after that things felt more natural.
